Some of the differences that I've noticed both in my code and in the coding process is that in TypeScript, you have to make sure to put exclamation points near some properties in order to not get an error, while in regular JavaScript, you don't need to do that. Another difference that I have noticed was that in TypeScript, you can't really link it to the HTML file, you have to compile it first, then link the HTML to the compiled JavaScript file, while in regular JavaScript, you just have to link the JavaScript file to the HTML file, without having to compile everything. One more thing that I have noticed is that in TypeScript, for some properties, you have to put it in parenthesis and insert "<>", and in those arrow brackets, insert "HTMLElement" in front of the property in order to not get an error for an element, while in regular JavaScript, you don't need to do that.
